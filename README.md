## HF-DDI: predicting drugâ€“drug interaction events based on multimodal hybrid fusion

![Framework](figture/HF-DDI.png = 0.8)

## Environment requirements
+ python          3.7 
+ tensorflow-gpu  2.8.0 
+ keras           2.8.0
+ numpy           1.20.3
+ pandas          1.3.4
+ scipy           1.7.1
+ scikit-learn    0.24.2

## Hardware Requirements
For experiments, GPU acceleration is recommended. I ran most of the experiments for this paper with two NVIDIA Tesla V100 16GB.
For the calculation of decision fusion, it's possible to run them on CPU. I tested this using a 1.7 GHz Intel Core, and it seemed to work fine.
